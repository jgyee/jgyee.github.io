# A Case Study in Multiple Correspondence Analysis: Clicker Question Responses to Cluster Different Types of Students

### Introduction:
For the purposes of this study, the main focus of analysis was to draw insights of the different types of both questions and students from the dataset of clicker question responses registered from an Undergraduate Introductory Statistics course at UCLA. The nature of the dataset led to the main method of statistical analysis – Multiple Correspondence Analysis. Dealing with categorical responses (Multiple Choice Answers), and no labels or semantic meaning behind any of the answer choices given, besides the key to the correct response, clustering methods and data analysis that did not rely on unavailable information were necessary. As such, the analysis of this study distinguishes between only two types of student responses: 1. Student responses that are either identical (Student 1 answering Question 1 with ‘A’ and Student 2 answering Question 1 with ‘A’), or 2. Student responses that are not identical, with each type of non-identical response being given the same ‘weight’ in terms of dissimilarity or distance metric.


###Exploratory Analysis:
To first understand the dataset, exploratory analysis of summary statistics was conducted. To start, I first looked at the summary statistics of the Questions variable, to assess the distribution of Question difficulty, as measured by total percent correct by each question.
